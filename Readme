Here is the explanatory material for paper 'Improving Reproducibility and Performance of Radiomics in Low Dose CT 
using Cycle GANs'.

Codes of this Cycle GAN are heavily reused from vanhuyz(https://github.com/vanhuyz/CycleGAN-TensorFlow) 

build_data.py used to build TFrecord to train Cycle GAN. As we mentioned in our paper, we introduced slice-paired 
training strategy in Cycle GAN training, in our execution of this strategy, we need to push training images into 
two TFrecords (TFrecord for original domain and for target domain) in paired manner. In other words, images need to 
store in paired manner in two
