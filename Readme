Here is code and support materials of paper 'Generative Models Improve Radiomics Performance in Different Tasks and
Different Datasets: An Experimental Study'

In the Repository of ENDs Radiomics features and an Example of TFrecord, you can find the summary of radiomics
features calculated from encoder-decoder network denoised LIDC-IDRI dataset (in EDNsummary.xlsx file), summary of
normalized radiomics (in EDNnormalizedsummary.xlsx file) and summary of simulation neagtive bags (in
ENDsimulationNegativeSummary.xlsx file) and an example of MIL training and testing TFrecord.


You can use maketfrecord.py to create a new training and testing TFrecord by using normalizedsummary.xlsx and 
simulationNegativeSummary.xlsx file as mentioned above.
You can use MILnetwork.py to run and vaildate our proposed methods
