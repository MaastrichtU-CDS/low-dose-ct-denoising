Here is the explanatory material for paper'Reproducibility of Radiomic features in CT : effect of noise and comparison of denoising using different generative models'

Three generative models --Encoder-decoder network, Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks(CGAN), Cycle GAN-- were selected as test models. This part of content
focus on executing project. The flowchart of executing code of this project was show as follow.

You can find source codes of CGAN and the link of pretrained models in this branch.

As you can see, there are three code files in our CGAN model,
