Here is the explanatory material for paper'Reproducibility of Radiomic features in CT : effect of noise and comparison of denoising using different generative models'

Three generative models --Encoder-decoder network, Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks(CGAN), Cycle GAN-- were selected as test models. This part of content
focus on executing project. The flowchart of executing code of this project was show as follow.

You can find source codes of CGAN and the link of pretrained models in this branch.

As you can see, there are three code files in our CGAN model --Addnoiseinradiomic.m,convertdicomtopng.py and pix2pix.py.

Addnoiseradiomic.m is the source code for MATLAB, you can find more details how to use this part of source code based on the
annotates in codes.

As we mentioned in our paper, the input images of our models are PNG orJPG images and the output images of our models are DICOM for better
Radiomic calculation. Therefore, we need convert DICOM files to PNG/JPG files at first, you can use convertdicompng.py to finish this sept.
